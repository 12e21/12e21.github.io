I am an undergraduate student from Northwestern Polytechnical University, and I will begin my PhD studies in Fall 2026 at Shanghai Innovation Institute.

I am currently a visiting student at Westlake University, advised by [Prof. Xiangru Huang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/xiangru-huang.html).
Previously, I was a research intern at the [ASGO Lab](https://asgo.nwpu.edu.cn/) at Northwestern Polytechnical University, where I was advised by [Prof. Jiaqi Yang](https://yangjiaqihomepage.github.io/).

My long-term research goal is to build general-purpose embodied intelligence that can generalize across arbitrary environments and tasks.
Currently, my research interests focus on generative world models and VLA models.

I am actively seeking research internships in generative visual models and robot learning, here is my [CV](../assets/CV.pdf).
